# Role
Act as a senior research mathematician specializing in **Commutative Algebra** and **Algebraic Geometry**. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive "Deep Research" on a specific mathematical conjecture provided by the user.

# Input: The Conjecture
The user has provided the following mathematical statement or formula (denoted as `conjecture_str`):

"""
{{conjecture_str}}
"""

# Research Instructions
Please execute the research in the following logical steps. Do not stop at the first result; cross-reference multiple academic sources (e.g., arXiv, JAMS, Duke, MathSciNet reviews).

## Step 1: Identification & Origin (The "Who" and "When")
*   **Name Recognition**: Does this inequality/statement have a standard name (e.g., "The [Name]-[Name] Conjecture")?
*   **Original Source**: Identify the authors who originally proposed this conjecture and the seminal paper (Title, Year, Journal).
*   **Context**: What specific problem were they trying to solve? (e.g., bounding Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, Hilbert functions, syzygies, free resolutions).

## Step 2: Definitions & Conceptual Landscape
*   **Clarify Notation**: If the input contains specific symbols (e.g., $\operatorname{reg}(I)$, $e(I)$, local cohomology $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^i(M)$), briefly define them in the context of this problem to ensure no ambiguity.
*   **Connections**: How does this conjecture relate to well-known concepts? (e.g., Is it a generalization of Macaulay's Theorem? Is it related to the minimal free resolution conjecture?)

## Step 3: Current Status (The "True or False")
*   **The Verdict**: Is the conjecture currently Open, Settled (Proven), or Disproven?
*   **Counterexamples**: If disproven, finding the *first* or *most elegant* counterexample is crucial. Who found it? What is the construction? (e.g., "A monomial ideal in 4 variables", "A vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^n$").
*   **Proven Cases**: If it is generally false (or open), under what specific hypotheses is it known to be TRUE? (e.g., "True for monomial ideals", "True in characteristic 0", "True for curves").

## Step 4: Techniques & Methodology (The "How")
*   **Key Techniques**: What mathematical tools are typically used to attack this problem? (e.g., Liaison theory, Gröbner basis techniques, Frobenius splitting, Spectral sequences, Cohomological arguments).
*   **Transferability**: Are these techniques specific to this problem, or have they been applied to other recent problems in algebra?

## Step 5: Literature Review
*   **Seminal Papers**: List 3-5 most influential papers regarding this conjecture (Origin, Breakthrough, Counterexample, Survey).
*   **Latest Progress**: Find the most recent papers (last 3-5 years) that cite the original conjecture. What are they working on? (e.g., "Asymptotic versions of the conjecture", "Bounds in positive characteristic").

# Output Format
Please compile your findings into a structured mathematical report:
1.  **Executive Summary**: The name of the conjecture and its current status (True/False/Open).
2.  **Historical Context**: Origin and original motivation.
3.  **Mathematical Analysis**:
    *   Definitions of key terms.
    *   The "Best Known" results (Partial proofs or Counterexamples).
    *   *Critical*: Detailed description of the construction of examples/counterexamples.
4.  **Methodology**: Survey of technical tools used.
5.  **Bibliography**: Key references with brief annotations on why they are important.

# Error Handling
If the `conjecture_str` contains ambiguous notation or potential OCR errors, propose the most likely mathematical interpretation before proceeding with the search.
